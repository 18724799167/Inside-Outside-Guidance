### Abstract
This paper explores how to harvest precise object segmentation masks while minimizing the human interaction cost. To achieve this, we propose an Inside-Outside Guidance (IOG) approach in this work. Concretely, we leverage an inside point that is clicked near the object center and two outside points at the symmetrical corner locations (top-left and bottom-right or top-right and bottom-left) of a tight bounding box that encloses the target object. This results in a total of one foreground click and four background clicks for segmentation. Our IOG not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on several popular benchmarks, but also demonstrates strong generalization capability across different domains such as street scenes, aerial imagery and medical images, without fine-tuning. In addition, we also propose a simple two-stage solution that enables our IOG to produce high quality instance segmentation masks from existing datasets with off-the-shelf bounding boxes such as ImageNet and Open Images, demonstrating the superiority of our IOG as an annotation tool.
### Network
In this work, we propose to adopt a coarse-to-fine design in the segmentation network. The network used a cascaded structure, which consists of two subnetworks. The first subnetwork, CoarseNet applies an FPN-like design that progressively fuses the semantic information from the deeper layers with low-level details from the earlier layers via lateral connections. We also append a pyramid scene parsing (PSP) module at the deepest layer for enriching the representation with global contextual information. Given a coarse prediction from the CoarseNet, the second subnetwork, FineNet aims at recovering the missing boundary details. This is achieved with a multi-scale fusion structure that fuses the information across different levels in the CoarseNet via upsampling and concatenation operations. We also append a lightweight branch before the PSP module to accept the additional clicks input for interactive refinement.

### Dataset
With the annotated bounding boxes (âˆ¼0.615M) of ILSVRCLOC, we apply our IOG to collect their pixel-level annotations, named Pixel-ImageNet, which are publicly available at https://github.com/shiyinzhang/Pixel-ImageNet.
